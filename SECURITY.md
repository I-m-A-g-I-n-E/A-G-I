# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policies and procedures for the A-G-I project, including vulnerability reporting, responsible disclosure, and security best practices.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

The A-G-I project takes security seriously. As a research platform dealing with advanced computational methods and potential commercial applications, we maintain strong security practices to protect:

- **Research Integrity**: Ensuring computational results are reliable and untampered
- **Intellectual Property**: Protecting proprietary algorithms and methodologies  
- **User Safety**: Preventing malicious use of the technology
- **Commercial Interests**: Securing commercial licensing and business operations

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure Process

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow our responsible disclosure process:

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Reporting Channels

**Primary Contact Methods**:
1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred): Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
2. **Email**: Contact maintainers through official repository contact methods (see README.md)
3. **Encrypted Communication**: PGP keys available upon request for sensitive disclosures

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much detail as possible:

**Vulnerability Details**:
- Clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Proof of concept (if applicable)
- Assessment of potential impact
- Suggested mitigation or fix (if known)

**System Information**:
- Operating system and version
- Python version and environment details
- Relevant dependency versions
- Hardware specifications (if relevant)

**Timeline Information**:
- When was the vulnerability discovered?
- Has it been disclosed to others?
- Any planned disclosure timeline

### Response Timeline

**Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of report receipt  
**Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days  
**Progress Updates**: Weekly until resolution  
**Resolution Target**: 90 days for critical issues, longer for complex vulnerabilities

## üîç Security Scope

### In Scope

**Core Software Components**:
- 48-manifold computational algorithms

### Out of Scope

**External Dependencies**: Security issues in third-party libraries should be reported to the respective maintainers first, then to us if they specifically affect our implementation.

**General Security Practices**: Issues like weak passwords, general system hardening, or generic security advice are not considered vulnerabilities.

**Theoretical Attacks**: Academic or theoretical vulnerabilities without practical exploitation scenarios.
