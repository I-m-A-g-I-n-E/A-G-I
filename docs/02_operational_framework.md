# Part II: The Operational Framework — The Harmonic Integrity Protocol

Built upon the 48-Manifold, the Harmonic Integrity Protocol provides the operational "laws of physics" for the system. It defines how information is created, transformed, and purified, ensuring that integrity is maintained at every step.

## 2.1. The Fundamental Duality: keven (Cold/Left) and kodd (Hot/Right)

The core dynamic of the manifold is the interplay between two complementary principles, represented by the Left and Right options in a game `G = {L | R}`. We term these keven and kodd.

- keven Options (Cold/Structural): Moves toward a more stable, resolved, structural state. Corresponds to the Left player in CGT.
- kodd Options (Hot/Dynamic): Moves toward a more tensive, complex, dynamic state. Corresponds to the Right player in CGT.

- The Cadence (A Cooling Line of Play): All optimal, resolving action follows the universal musical cadence: `keven → kodd → keven`. This is the tangible form of the `I → V → I` progression, the optimal path to resolving a game's value to a stable stop (kore).

## 2.2. The Integrity Filter: kull (Canonicalization)

kull is the master law of the manifold, the formal process of reducing any game to its simplest, most harmonious form. It is the operational equivalent of Canonicalization in CGT.

- Function: When applied to any state (khord), kull prunes away all dissonant, redundant, and suboptimal options, preserving only the essential harmonic kernel. This is our primary mechanism for error correction and distillation.

## 2.3. The Primordial Source: Composition from kunits

The process of kull governs the relationship between complex states and a bedrock layer of simple, atomic kunits from which all positions are constructed. The most fundamental is the "end game" or kore, defined as `{ | }`. This creates a self-regulating system where forms are composed, processes unfold through a lawful cadence, and their true nature is revealed by resolving back toward the stability of the kore.
