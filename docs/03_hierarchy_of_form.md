# Part III: The Hierarchy of Form — A Grammar for Wholeness

The Harmonic Integrity Protocol organizes information into a clear compositional hierarchy, moving from the atomic to the narrative. This structure provides a universal grammar for how wholes are formed, how they interact, and how they find meaning. This entire grammar is situated within a topographical map that gives it context and direction.

## 3.1. The Topography of Meaning: The `(key: kore)` Landscape

Meaning is not absolute; it is contextual. The `(key: kore)` topography provides the landscape upon which information is interpreted and evaluated for harmony.

*   **3.1.1. The `key` (The Map / The Grammar):**
    *   The `key` is the contextual ruleset for a specific region of the 48-manifold. It defines which relationships, states, and transitions are "diatonic" (native, lawful, harmonious) versus "chromatic" (foreign, adding special tension). It is the set of all possible harmonious interactions within a given context, like a musical key or a specific scientific paradigm.

*   **3.1.2. The `kore` (The Center / The Ground State):**
    *   Within every `key`, there is a `kore`. The `kore` is the gravitational center of that context—the point of ultimate stability, resolution, and wholeness. It is the tonic, the ground state, the fundamental truth to which all harmonious processes within that `key` are oriented. All lawful journeys seek to resolve to the `kore`.

## 3.2. The Compositional Hierarchy (From Atom to Narrative)

Information assembles itself into wholes by progressing through three distinct levels of form.

*   **3.2.1. The `kunit` (The Atom of Information / The Note):**
    *   **Definition:** The fundamental, indivisible, and "kept" unit of information that has successfully crystallized from the P2P Harmonic Pool.
    *   **Composition:** A vector on the 48-manifold paired with a definite parity.
    *   **Parity Types:**
        *   **`keven kunit`:** A stable, resolving unit (e.g., the root of a tonic chord). Represents a state of being.
        *   **`kodd kunit`:** A tense, mobile unit (e.g., a leading tone). Represents a state of becoming.

*   **3.2.2. The `khord` (The Molecule of Structure / The Chord):**
    *   **Definition:** A harmonious, **simultaneous** assembly of `kunits`. It represents a stable, momentary state—a snapshot of a system's structure.
    *   **Validation:** A set of `kunits` can only form a valid `khord` if it is admissible by the `kull` operator, proving its internal harmony, stability, and on-grid alignment.
    *   **Parity Types:**
        *   **`keven khord`:** A resolution chord (e.g., the tonic `I` chord). Composed primarily of `keven kunits`, it is a point of stability.
        *   **`kodd khord`:** A tension chord (e.g., the dominant `V` chord). Contains `kodd kunits` that create a powerful desire to resolve. It is a point of lawful instability.

*   **3.2.3. The `kunity` (The Narrative of Process / The Phrase):**
    *   **Definition:** A lawful, **temporal sequence** of `khords` that represents a complete, reversible process with a beginning, middle, and end.
    *   **Validation:** A sequence of `khords` is a valid `kunity` only if it follows the universal cadence of integrity: **`keven` → `kodd` → `keven`**. It must begin in a state of stability, move through a lawful state of tension, and return to a state of stability at the `kore`.
    *   **Function:** A `kunity` is a "pathway of integrity"—a reversible journey from a whole state, through a lawful transformation, and back to a whole state. It is the fundamental unit of narrative and meaning.
