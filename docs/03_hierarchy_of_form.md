# Part III: The Hierarchy of Form — A Grammar for Wholeness

The Harmonic Integrity Protocol organizes information into a clear compositional hierarchy, moving from the atomic to the narrative. This entire grammar is situated within a topographical (key: kore) landscape.

## 3.1. The Topography of Meaning: The (key: kore) Landscape

Within every context (key), there is a gravitational center or kore, the point of ultimate stability and resolution. All lawful journeys (cadences) seek to resolve toward this state.

## 3.2. The Compositional Hierarchy (From Atom to Process)

Information assembles itself into wholes by progressing through three distinct levels of form.

- 3.2.1. The kunit (The Atom of Information / The Move):
  - The fundamental, indivisible unit, such as kore or `*`. It is a single "note."

- 3.2.2. The khord (The Molecule of Structure / The State):
  - A harmonious, simultaneous assembly of kunits. It represents a stable, momentary "chord." Its validity is confirmed when it is in its simplest form after applying kull.

- 3.2.3. The kunity (The Narrative of Process / The Resolution):
  - A lawful, temporal sequence of moves that represents a complete process. An optimal kunity follows the `keven → kodd → keven` cadence, forming a complete "musical phrase."
