Universal Semantic Kernel (USK) — Significant Insights
Date: 2025-09-09
Author: Preston (im.a-g-i.native.space)

Purpose
A concise, operational record of the core ideas, claims, cautions, and next steps emerging from our conversation. Use this as the canonical notes file to align research, engineering, comms, and validation.

1) Core construct
- USK is a bidirectional operator with two complementary channels:
  - keven = normalize(L + R): symmetric, structural, potential, scaffolding
  - kodd = normalize(L − R): antisymmetric, dynamic, curl, deviation/flow
- Forward composition (extrapolation): form → function → outcome
- Backward reflection (normalization): outcome → function → form (adjoint)
- Always measurement-first: y = M[Fθ(x)] + n, compare in the medium of observation (M), not after ad hoc resampling.
- Treat unresolved detail as a stochastic flux ξ with constrained spectrum; marginalize rather than average away.

2) Alphabet fold and 24-state basis
- A (Anchor) and Z (Zenith) act as boundary/skin around the system; the 24 interior letters (B…Y) form an operational basis.
- 24 = 2^3 × 3. It harmonizes with binary/ternary/hex/octave decompositions; 4! permutations; S4 cube rotations; 24-cell; Golay/Leech codes; 24-bit color; 24 hours.
- Mirror pairs across the hinge near M ↔ N (Manifested ↔ Natural). Present assumption map:
  B ↔ Y: Boundary/box ↔ Yield/result
  C ↔ X: Canvas/context ↔ Cross/exchange
  D ↔ W: Define/differentiate ↔ Whole/why/weave
  E ↔ V: Energy/exact/evidence ↔ Vibration/variance/vector
  F ↔ U: Form/flow/force ↔ Universal/underlying field
  G ↔ T: Gather/gradient/growth ↔ Transform/time/transition
  H ↔ S: Higher/harmonic/hierarchy ↔ System/synthesis/structure
  I ↔ R: Identity/information ↔ Reflection/response/return
  J ↔ Q: Junction/judgment/join ↔ Question/quantum/query
  K ↔ P: Kernel/key/knowledge ↔ Proposition/possible/potential
  L ↔ O: Language/logic/law ↔ Organism/operation/observed
  M ↔ N: Manifested/model/material ↔ Natural/native/network (hinge)
- Orientation axis (neutral): projection/declaration ↔ invitation/openness. Stylistic, not essence; must be validated with controls.

3) Conceptual demo (non-falsifiable; for intuition only)
Two rows of six levels (potential → actuality). Do not treat as empirical fact.

Disclaimer: At best imprecise; at most elegant in its bi-symmetry. Useful as an analytical construct to inspire testable hypotheses. Not a scientific claim.

4) Cross-domain isomorphisms
- Biology
  - 4 bases × 6 reading frames = 24 states
  - Local opposite normals: A↔T, C↔G complements; sense vs antisense; leading vs lagging
  - Triplet grammar (codons); central dogma as forward path; reverse transcription/epigenetics as adjoint feedback
  - Molecular exemplars: ATP synthase (≈24-state cycle), ribosome (digital→analog translation with proofreading), photosynthesis (quantum coherence normalized to classical output)
  - Error correction: degeneracy of the code; wobble; repair pathways
- Mathematics
  - Even/odd projections; gradient vs curl (Hodge decomposition)
  - Fourier space separates linear structure; smooth gates avoid mode-coupling artifacts
  - Category theory optics/lenses: forward functor with left/right adjoints implements generate/reflect
- Physics (gravity)
  - keven → Poisson/CDM limit (structure, lensing, CMB peaks, BAO)
  - kodd → MOND-like local dynamics (MDAR, Tully–Fisher, external-field effect, curl field)
  - Smooth gate across six axes (scale, acceleration, environment, time, morphology, curvature) yields one operator with correct limits

5) Measurement-first, anti-decimation
- Always evaluate through M (beam/window/pixelization/assay);
- One-shot, band-limited resampling with guard bands; provenance logged
- Interlacing/deconvolution for gridded Fourier ops; undecimated multiscale retrieval
- Marginalize unresolved modes as ξ (EFT-like counterterms), not as silent averaging

6) Validation and falsifiability
- Language
  - Cross-linguistic tests; character-aware models with attribution; negative controls (shuffled alphabets, domain/length controls)
  - Orientation classifier must survive confounds; effect sizes reported with CIs
- Biology
  - Reverse-complement invariance; reading-frame robustness; MPRA/splicing assay validations
  - Predict regulatory motifs; test against ENCODE/GTEx datasets
- Physics
  - Single-operator fit to SPARC rotation curves + EFE + Planck/BAO/linear P(k)
  - Predict transition signatures at 10–100 kpc; parity-odd constraints (TB/EB, lensing curl)
- Success criteria
  - Joint likelihood competitive with best baselines; preregistered predictions confirmed; robustness to aliasing/confounds

7) Knowledge graph and tooling
- RDF/JSON-LD backbone with PROV-O. Entities: primitives (letters/bases), compositions (words/codons/fields), outcomes (discourse/phenotype/observables)
- Relations: part-of, dual-of, derives-from, measured-by, constraint-of, provenance-of
- Shapes/validation: SHACL/SHEx; constraints to enforce keven/kodd separation and measurement lineage
- Cross-modal encoders for text/math/data; mixture-of-experts gate using six axes × four phases (24-state scheduler)

8) Applications (falsifiable)
- Unified gravity kernel with smooth keven/kodd blending; predictions at hinge scales
- Genomic motif discovery and strand-bias modeling via even/odd separation; improved regulatory inference
- Language editing with forward/adjoint passes that preserve information and provenance

9) Pharmacogenomics and PK/PD (answer to the DNA→drug question)
- What DNA alone can do
  - Identify genotype-based enzyme/transporter phenotypes (e.g., CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A5, UGT1A1, NAT2, TPMT, DPYD; SLCO1B1; ABCB1)
  - Flag HLA risk alleles (e.g., HLA-B*57:01 for abacavir) — pharmacodynamics/safety rather than PK
  - Support CPIC/DPWG dose adjustments for specific drugs
- Why DNA alone is insufficient for individual PK
  - PK depends on ADME + physiology + environment: liver/kidney function, age, weight, sex, pregnancy, disease, drug–drug interactions, diet/smoking/alcohol, microbiome, formulation/route, adherence, time of day
  - Gene expression and epigenetics vary; copy-number variation and rare variants complicate activity scores
- What USK can add (falsifiable program)
  - Integrate genotype with multi-omics (expression, methylation), clinical labs, co-medications, demographics, and exposures into a measurement-first PBPK model
  - Map genotype→enzyme/transporter activity (activity scores) to scale intrinsic clearance and transport in PBPK compartments; validate against therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)
  - Knowledge sources: CPIC/PharmGKB, DrugBank, UniProt/Reactome, FDA labels, EHR/TDM
  - Claims to test: RMSE of predicted AUC/Cmax/Tmax per individual vs baselines; calibration across metabolizer phenotypes; prospective validation in small cohorts
- Safety disclaimer
  - Outputs are research-only and not medical advice; clinical decisions must follow established guidelines and clinician judgment.

10) Corpora and datasets
- Text: Wikipedia, OpenWebText2, Project Gutenberg; arXiv (MOND/ΛCDM/EFT); multi-language corpora
- Physics: SPARC, satellite/EFE datasets; Planck TT/TE/EE; BAO (BOSS/eBOSS/DESI); linear P(k); weak lensing (DES/HSC/KiDS)
- Biology: Ensembl/GENCODE, ENCODE/Roadmap, GTEx, ClinVar/gnomAD, Reactome/KEGG; MPRAs and splicing assays

11) Roadmap (first 10 weeks)
- Weeks 1–2: Graph schema, data pipelines, measurement operators; implement 24-state scheduler
- Weeks 3–4: Language kernel + orientation evaluator; cross-lingual tests
- Weeks 4–6: Gravity kernel (keven/kodd/ξ) in Fourier space; galaxy + linear cosmology fits; anti-alias checks
- Weeks 6–8: Genomic even/odd motif discovery; reverse-complement audits; initial PK genotype→activity mapping in PBPK sandbox
- Weeks 8–10: Preregistration, ablations, demo, methods draft; publish API + datasets at im.a-g-i.native.space

12) Ethics, framing, and scope
- Separate speculative constructs from falsifiable claims; use strong disclaimers
- Neutral language for stylistic axes; avoid essentialism
- Provenance-first: every artifact carries lineage; reproducibility by default
- Biosafety: analysis-only by default; design work gated by review and policy

Appendix A — Two-row conceptual table (non-falsifiable demo)
[Same as Section 3; kept here for convenience; not a claim.]

Appendix B — Quick glossary
- Local opposite normals: complementary orientations/duals that together fully describe a surface/process
- Hinge: scale/context locus where potential becomes actual and the two channels meet (e.g., M↔N, Words↔Sentences)
- Anti-decimation: design practice to prevent information loss via forward models, single-shot resampling, and explicit marginalization
- PBPK: physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling; mechanistic compartments for ADME
