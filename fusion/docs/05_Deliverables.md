# Module 05: Final Deliverables

## 1. Rationale & Purpose

This module defines the final, packaged outputs of the MVP. While the other modules contain the components and raw materials, this directory is about creating the polished, high-impact assets that will be presented to investors and potential experimental partners.

The purpose of these deliverables is to tell a clear, compelling, and data-backed story. They must translate the complex results from the benchmarking harness into undeniable proof of the 48-manifold system's value. Each deliverable is tailored to a specific audience and objective, from a high-level executive pitch to a detailed scientific proposal for a facility.

This is the "so what?" of the project. It is where we make our case and define the path forward to physical experimentation.

## 2. List of Deliverables

### 2.1. The Whitepaper (`48CB_Whitepaper_v1.0.pdf`)
- **Audience:** Technical evaluators, facility scientists, sophisticated investors.
- **Content:** A concise (5-10 page) scientific paper detailing:
    - The core concepts of the 48-manifold control framework.
    - The architecture of the 48CB-Core controller.
    - The methodology of the benchmarking study.
    - The full, statistically significant results of the benchmark, including all key plots and tables from the harness.
    - A clear discussion of the results and their implications for the future of fusion control.
- **Format:** A professionally formatted PDF, typeset in LaTeX for a polished, academic feel.

### 2.2. The Pitch Deck (`48CB_Pitch_Deck_v1.0.pdf`)
- **Audience:** Investors (VCs, strategic partners), program managers.
- **Content:** A visually-driven 10-slide presentation that makes the business and strategic case for the project.
    - **Slide 1: Title:** "Prevent 75% of Fusion Disruptions With Software Alone."
    - **Slide 2: The Problem:** Disruptions are the #1 risk to fusion economics and timelines.
    - **Slide 3: The Solution:** Introduce the 48-manifold as a new paradigm: "Symmetric, Reversible Control."
    - **Slide 4: Our MVP:** The 48-Control Bench.
    - **Slide 5: The "Killer Demo":** The Disruption Onset Temperature (DOT) curve, showing we can see failures coming earlier and more clearly.
    - **Slide 6: The Results:** A summary of the key benchmark improvements (5x fewer disruptions, +20% performance, etc.).
    - **Slide 7: The Ask:** The specific funding and/or resources required for the next phase.
    - **Slide 8: The Team:** Who we are.
    - **Slide 9: The Roadmap:** From software to a pilot experiment to a licensed product.
    - **Slide 10: Contact Info.**

### 2.3. The Reproducibility Package (`reproducibility_package_v1.0.zip`)
- **Audience:** Due diligence teams, collaborating scientists.
- **Content:** A compressed archive containing everything needed for a third party to replicate our main results.
    - A lightweight, containerized (e.g., Docker) environment.
    - The benchmark datasets (or a pointer to download them).
    - The experiment definition file for the key benchmark run.
    - A single script (`run_benchmark.sh`) that executes the benchmark and generates the final report.
- **Goal:** To make our core claims unimpeachably credible by making them fully transparent and verifiable.

### 2.4. The Facility Pilot Proposal (`DIII-D_Pilot_Proposal_v1.0.pdf`)
- **Audience:** The scientific and engineering leadership of a specific fusion facility (e.g., DIII-D).
- **Content:** A short, formal proposal for a dedicated experimental run.
    - **Scientific Justification:** Briefly summarize the simulation results and the specific hypothesis to be tested.
    - **Proposed Experiment:** Define the exact, pre-registered experiment (e.g., a 48-phase RMP phasing DOE).
    - **Methodology:** Describe the control actions to be taken, emphasizing the use of small, reversible, and safe micro-steps.
    - **Requested Time:** The number of shots required (~20).
    - **Success Criteria:** The pre-defined, measurable outcomes that will constitute a successful experiment (e.g., a 2x reduction in disruption probability).
    - **Safety Case:** A brief analysis of why the proposed experiment poses minimal risk to the machine.

## 3. Success Criteria
- The whitepaper is clear, concise, and scientifically rigorous.
- The pitch deck can successfully communicate the project's value to a non-expert in under 5 minutes.
- The reproducibility package allows an independent user to replicate our headline KPI results with a single command.
- The facility proposal is credible, safe, and compelling enough to be seriously considered for experimental time.
