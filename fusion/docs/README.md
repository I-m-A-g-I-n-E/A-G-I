# Project 48-Control Bench (48CB): A Software-First MVP for Fusion Control

## 1. Project Vision

The central hypothesis of this project is that the chronic instabilities plaguing nuclear fusion research—from tokamak disruptions to ICF asymmetries—are not merely physics problems, but are exacerbated by the fundamental limitations of current control paradigms. Conventional controllers often introduce "unforced errors" through irreversible actions, information loss (decimation), and suboptimal reactions to complex, high-dimensional state spaces.

This project proposes a new control framework based on the **48-manifold system**. It treats control not as a problem of brute-force reaction, but as a **combinatorial game** to be won through superior strategy. By enforcing principles of **reversibility, symmetry, and measurement-first data processing**, we can create a controller that is inherently more stable, efficient, and robust.

## 2. The MVP: A Software-Only Deliverable

The goal of this initial phase is to deliver a **purely software-based Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** that can rigorously demonstrate the value of this new approach using existing historical data and high-fidelity simulations.

The MVP, codenamed **48-Control Bench (48CB)**, is a digital twin and benchmarking harness designed to prove, with statistically significant evidence, that our controller would have prevented real-world failures and can unlock higher performance regimes.

Success in this phase will provide the undeniable justification for investment in physical hardware integration and on-device experimental validation.

## 3. Modular Structure

This project is organized into five distinct, deliverable-focused modules. Each module has a specific purpose and a detailed `README.md` file explaining its rationale and architecture. The modules are:

- **[01_48CB_Core](./01_48CB_Core/):** The "brain" of the project. This is the core software library that implements the 48-manifold control algorithms, including the canonicalization engine and the 48-phase scheduler.

- **[02_Simulators](./02_Simulators/):** The "sandbox." This module contains the fast, reduced-order simulators for both tokamak and ICF physics that provide a controlled environment for testing and large-scale experimentation.

- **[03_Bench_Harness](./03_Bench_Harness/):** The "science." This is the automated framework for running rigorous, reproducible benchmark comparisons between the 48CB controller and conventional baselines.

- **[04_Datasets](./04_Datasets/):** The "ground truth." This module defines and houses the curated historical and synthetic datasets that are used to validate the controller's performance.

- **[05_Deliverables](./05_Deliverables/):** The "pitch." This contains the final, polished outputs of the project—the whitepaper, the investor deck, the reproducibility package, and the facility pilot proposal that together make the case for the next phase of development.

## 4. Path to Validation

The project follows a clear, logical path from code to on-device validation:

1.  **Develop Core Engine:** Build the core `48CB` controller.
2.  **Simulate & Benchmark:** Use the simulators and harness to generate overwhelming evidence of the controller's superior performance in a digital environment.
3.  **Validate on Historical Data:** Prove that the controller would have prevented documented failures on real-world machines.
4.  **Package & Propose:** Use the polished deliverables to secure a pilot experiment at a major fusion facility.
5.  **Execute Physical Experiment:** Demonstrate the performance gains on a real tokamak or ICF facility.

This software-first approach de-risks the project significantly, ensuring that by the time we request expensive experimental time, we have already proven the concept with a high degree of certainty.
