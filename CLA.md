# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**A-G-I Project Individual Contributor License Agreement v1.0**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the A-G-I project (the "Project") operated by I-m-A-g-I-n-E ("us", "we", or "our"). To participate as a contributor, please review and accept this Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Purpose

This CLA clarifies the terms under which you contribute intellectual property to the Project. It ensures that:
- We can legally incorporate your contributions
- We maintain clear rights to manage, distribute, and commercialize the Project
- You retain appropriate rights to your contributions
- The community benefits from your contributions under clear legal terms

## Agreement

By submitting a contribution to this Project (through pull requests, issues, or any other mechanism), you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to us and to recipients of software distributed by us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell your contributions and such derivative works.

### 2. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to us and to recipients of software distributed by us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your contributions alone or by combination of your contributions with the Project.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against you or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your contribution, or the Project to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this CLA for that contribution or Project shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 3. Right to Relicense

You acknowledge and agree that we may license your contributions under any license terms we deem appropriate, including but not limited to:
- The current A-G-I Source-Available Protective License (SAPL)
- Future open-source licenses (such as Apache-2.0, MIT, GPL, AGPL, etc.)
- Commercial or proprietary licenses
- Multiple licenses simultaneously (dual/multi-licensing)

This right to relicense is perpetual and irrevocable, allowing us maximum flexibility in how we distribute and monetize the Project.

### 4. Your Rights and Representations

You represent and warrant that:

a) **Authority**: You have the legal authority to enter into this CLA. If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, you represent that you have authority to bind your employer to this CLA.

b) **Originality**: Each of your contributions is your original creation and/or you have sufficient rights to grant the licenses herein. If your contribution includes material from third parties, you have obtained all necessary permissions and will clearly identify such third-party materials.

c) **No Conflicts**: Your contribution does not violate any existing agreements, obligations, or third-party rights.

d) **Compliance**: Your contribution complies with the Project's contribution guidelines and does not contain malicious code, security vulnerabilities, or other harmful elements.

### 5. Inbound = Outbound + Enhanced Rights

Your contributions are made under the "inbound = outbound" principle, meaning contributions are made under the same license terms as the Project's current license, PLUS the additional rights granted in this CLA. This provides us with broader rights than typical open-source contributions while maintaining consistency for the community.

### 6. No Employment Relationship

This CLA does not create any employment, partnership, or agency relationship between you and us. You are contributing as an independent party.

### 7. Continuing Effect

This CLA applies to all contributions you have previously made, are currently making, or will make in the future to the Project, until you provide written notice of termination. However, licenses already granted for existing contributions remain perpetual and irrevocable.

### 8. No Assignment Required

You retain ownership of your contributions. This CLA is a license, not an assignment, though the rights granted are broad and perpetual.

### 9. Employer Considerations

If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create (including your contributions), you represent that:
- Your employer has waived such rights for your contributions to this Project, OR
- Your employer has provided a separate Corporate CLA covering your contributions, OR
- You have obtained appropriate permissions from your employer

### 10. Support and Warranties

You are not expected to provide support for your contributions, except to the extent you desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.

**YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND.**
