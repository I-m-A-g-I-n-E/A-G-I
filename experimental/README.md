# Experimental Directory

This directory contains experimental research modules that explore advanced aspects of the 48-Manifold system.

## Modules

- **`hand.py`** - The Hand Tensor: Five-finger routing through the 48-manifold
  - Explores gesture-based computation where physical gesture becomes computational reality
  - Each finger represents a distinct tensor channel with specific semantic meaning

- **`human.py`** - 48-Manifold Linguistic State Machine
  - Combines fractal reversibility with alphabetic resonance
  - Analyzes words by mapping each letter to a resonance value and aggregates these to compute a linguistic state or classification
  - Special focus on W (possibility routing) and M (reality manifestation)

- **`fractal_container.py`** - Container-based fractal implementations
  - Experimental approaches to fractal organization and storage

## Status

These modules are research explorations and may not be fully integrated with the main system. They represent investigations into different aspects of the 48-manifold framework including gesture-based computing, linguistic processing, and alternative organizational structures.

## Usage

These modules may have dependencies on the main manifold system:
```python
from experimental.hand import FingerChannel, HandTensor
from experimental.human import AlphabeticResonator
```
