# Experimental Directory

This directory contains experimental research modules that explore advanced aspects of the 48-Manifold system.

## Modules

- **`hand.py`** - Implements the HandTensor and FingerChannel classes for gesture-based computation
  - Provides data structures to model a hand as a tensor with five channels, each corresponding to a finger
  - Each FingerChannel represents a separate computational pathway, allowing for parallel processing or routing of data through the HandTensor

- **`human.py`** - 48-Manifold Linguistic State Machine
  - Combines fractal reversibility with alphabetic resonance
  - Analyzes words by mapping each letter to a resonance value and aggregates these to compute a linguistic state or classification
  - Special focus on W (possibility routing) and M (reality manifestation)

- **`fractal_container.py`** - Container-based fractal implementations
  - Experimental approaches to fractal organization and storage

## Status

These modules are research explorations and may not be fully integrated with the main system. They represent investigations into different aspects of the 48-manifold framework including gesture-based computing, linguistic processing, and alternative organizational structures.

## Usage

These modules may have dependencies on the main manifold system:
```python
from experimental.hand import FingerChannel, HandTensor
from experimental.human import AlphabeticResonator
```
