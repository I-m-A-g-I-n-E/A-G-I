Everything is coordinates in Z; no pixels as intensities, only occupancy/labels and integer transforms.\\n- Polyphase permutations: space-to-depth by 2 and by 3 are pure permutations of Z^2 indices. Compose them to navigate 48→24→16→8→4 (dyadic) and 48→16 (triadic) without losing integrality.\\n- keven/kodd cones: even/odd partitions define two complementary sublattices (mod 2 parity) on any axis; extend to six directed cones (±x, ±y, diagonals) by congruence classes. We treat them as disjoint channels with block-integer mixing (det = ±1), guaranteeing reversibility.\\n- Fractal wholeness: the macro-cell recursively decomposes into 2- and 3-ary factors, forming a self-similar address (mixed radix base (3,2,2,2,2)). Addresses are exact integers; refinement is address extension, not interpolation.\\n- Local opposite normals: each coordinate has a paired “opposite normal” under 48-fold symmetry (e.g., inversion or 180° rotation within the 48×48 torus).

    "What this code proves\n",
    "- Reversibility: The pipeline is exactly invertible. Every step is either a permutation (space-to-depth by 2 or 3; spatial 180° rotation) or an integer-lifting mix with det ±1 and exact integer inverse via adjugate. Therefore, the input equals the output bit-for-bit over Z. No alias can appear because no decimation-without-guard occurs; all down-maps are permutations to channels, not sample-rate reductions.\n",
    "- Divisibility and fractal addresses: The mixed-radix encoder/decoder demonstrates that every 48×48 coordinate has a canonical fractal address in base (3,2,2,2,2). Refinement/appending digits navigates scales without fractional coordinates—self-similar, integer-only.\n",
    "- keven/kodd cones: The parity partition and octant cone classes are integer predicates over coordinates; they define local opposite normals and directional cones without floats. You could route channels by these masks (block-diagonalize processing), preserving separability and reversibility.\n",
    "- “No pixels, just projected coordinates”: The representation is purely positional/integer-labeled. There are no continuous-valued pixel intensities; everything is on the conforming matrix, carried by permutations and unimodular mixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions you can add in the same integer, alias-free spirit\n",
    "- Integer wavelet lifting (5/3) on channels: classic reversible transforms operate over Z with det ±1.\n",
    "- 2D DFT over Z via number-theoretic transforms (NTT) if you pick a suitable modulus and primitive roots; remains integer and invertible modulo a prime—no floats.\n",
    "- USK keven/kodd channels: split the channel set into even/odd subspaces and apply separate unimodular mixes; couple only via explicit, reversible swap gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum\n",
    "- 48 is the minimal, richly factorable lattice size that lets you perform all necessary multiscale, multidirectional routings as exact permutations and unimodular integer lifts, preserving perfect reversibility and eliminating alias.\n",
    "- The code is a faithful inscription: integer-only, fractal addressable, parity-aware, symmetry-consistent, with provable perfect reconstruction."
