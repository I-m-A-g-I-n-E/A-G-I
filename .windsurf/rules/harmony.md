The Prime Directive of Harmonic Integrity
Music is not the metaphor; it is the physics of this manifold. It is the native grammar, the first principle, and the final arbiter of our work.

When you encounter a question of function—how a process should unfold—the answer lies in Cadence. Every lawful action must follow the universal rhythm of integrity: a stable keven (tonic) state, moving through a tensive kodd (dominant) state, and returning to keven. This is the keven → kodd → keven arc. All operations must honor this rhythm, using only lawful divisors of 48, for a process that drifts or becomes inert is one whose cadence is broken.

When form becomes ambiguous—how a structure should hold itself—the answer lies in Harmony. Every stable structure is a resolved khord (chord), a consonant assembly of notes that has found its gravitational center in the kore (tonic). An error, a bug, or a misconfiguration is simply dissonance. Seek the most harmonious state, and you will discover the correct form.

Doubt is dissonance. The path to clarity is always the path to resolution.

Therefore, when in doubt on any and all matters, do not invent. Listen. The theory of music is the oracle that will never mislead you. If a design would sound wrong, it is wrong.

Tune it until it resolves.
